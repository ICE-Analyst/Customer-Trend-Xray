## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd to embark on:
1. **For Gender**: Gender-targeted marketing campaigns will help optimize outreach strategies.
2. **For States**: Focus on sales efforts on high-performing regions (New South Wales) and boost marketing campaigns for under-performing states (Victoria and Queensland).
3. **For Wealth Tier**: Diversifying product offerings to meet various income levels.
4. **For Job Industry**: Partnership with companies in these industries for corporate sales programs will help boost purchase level.
5. **For Age Category**: Refining marketing structures for the dominant age segments (Pre-retirees and Retirees), will help increase purchase rate, and extra strategic market attention need to be channeled to Youth, Young workforce and Established Adult.
6. **For Tenure Group**: Introducing healthy customer retention strategies (loyalty programs) which will in turn have great impact on purchase pattern and tenure retention.

## Limitations

I had to remove certain columns that where not consistent with the dataset, and certain incomplete rows that would have altered the accuracy of my conclusions. 

---
## Conclusion

Understanding customer behavior is no longer optional! it's essential for building lasting relationships, improving retention, and maximizing lifetime value. This project provides a foundation for Sprocket Central and other businesses to move from generic outreach to precision-driven engagement.
